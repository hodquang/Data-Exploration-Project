3,HARRY,Now you've done it.,Hedwig

control that bloody bird, it'll
have to go.",HARRY

From any of my friends. Not one.
All summer.",HARRY
4,DUDLEY,Who'd want to be friends with you?,HARRY
4,UNCLE VERNON,"I should think you'd be more
grateful. We raise you since you
were a baby, give you food off our
table, even let you have Dudley's
second bedroom... purely out of
the goodness of our hearts.",HARRY
4,DUDLEY,"I thought he got the second
bedroom because Mum was afraid
he'd turn us into dung beetles if
you put him back in the cupboard
under the stairs.",UNCLE VERNON

the Masons arrive.",DUDLEY

noise and pretending I don't

luck, this could well be the day I
make the biggest deal of my
career.",HARRY

is!",HARRY
6,HARRY,What... Who are you?,DOBBY

6,HARRY,"I see. Not to be rude or
anything, but this isn't a great
time for me to have a house-elf in
my bedroom.",DOBBY
6,DOBBY,"Oh, yes, sir, Dobby understands.
It's just that, Dobby has come to
tell you... it is difficult, sir...
Dobby wonders where to begin.",HARRY
6,HARRY,Why don't you sit down?,DOBBY
6,DOBBY,S-s-sit down?,HARRY
6,HARRY,"Shhhh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you or anything --",DOBBY
6,DOBBY,"Offend Dobby! Dobby has heard of
your greatness, sir, but never has
he been asked to sit down by a
wizard, like an equal...",HARRY
6,HARRY,"You can't have met many decent
wizards then.",DOBBY

7,UNCLE VERNON,"Our cat, tiger.",DUDLEY

8,DOBBY,"Dobby had to punish himself, sir.
Dobby almost spoke ill of his
family, sir.",HARRY
8,HARRY,Your... family?,DOBBY
8,DOBBY,"The wizard family Dobby serves,
sir. Dobby is bound to serve one
family forever. If they ever knew
Dobby was here...",HARRY
8,DOBBY,"But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn
him.",HARRY
8,DOBBY,"Harry Potter must not go back to
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry this year.",HARRY
8,HARRY,Not go back? But... I have to.,DOBBY
8,DOBBY,"This is a plot. A plot to make
most terrible things happen. If
Harry Potter goes back to school
he will be in great danger.",HARRY
8,HARRY,"What terrible things? Who's
plotting them?",DOBBY
8,HARRY,"Okay! I understand. You can't
say --",DOBBY

and --",MR. MASON
9,MR. MASON,"Sounds as if that cat of yours has
dragged something in with it,
Dursley.",UNCLE VERNON
9,UNCLE VERNON,Not to worry. I'll sort it out.,MR. MASON
10,HARRY,Stop! Stop!,DOBBY
10,UNCLE VERNON,"What the devil are you doing up
here! You've just ruined the
punch line of my Japanese golfer
joke. One more sound and you'll
wish you'd never been born, boy!",HARRY
10,HARRY,"See why I've got to go back? I
don't belong here. I belong in
your world -- at Hogwarts. It's
the only place I've got...
friends.",DOBBY
10,DOBBY,"Friends who don't even write to
Harry Potter?",HARRY
10,HARRY,"Well, I expect they've been --
hang on, how do you know my
friends haven't been writing me?
Guiltily, Dobby takes out a STACK of LETTERS.",DOBBY
10,DOBBY,"Harry Potter mustn't be angry with
Dobby -- Dobby hoped if Harry
Potter thought his friends had
forgotten him... Harry Potter
might not want to go back to
school, sir...",HARRY
10,HARRY,Give me those. Now.,DOBBY
11,HARRY,Dobby... Please... No...,DOBBY
11,DOBBY,"Harry Potter must say he's not
going back to school.",HARRY
11,HARRY,I can't. Hogwarts is my home.,DOBBY
11,DOBBY,"Then Dobby must do it, sir. For
Harry Potter's own good.",HARRY
11,UNCLE VERNON,"I'm sorry. It's our nephew. Very
disturbed. Meeting strangers
upsets him, so we kept him
upstairs...",MR. MASON

11,UNCLE VERNON,Go on. Read it.,HARRY
11,HARRY,"Dear Mr. Potter. We have

seven this evening. As you know,
underage wizards...'",UNCLE VERNON

spells outside school.' You didn't tell us you weren't
Allowed to use magic at home.
Slipped your mind, didn't it?",HARRY
11,UNCLE VERNON,"Well, I've got news for you, boy.
I'm locking you up! And if you
try to magic yourself out, they'll
expel you! You're never going
back to that school! Never!",HARRY

thing. Dad loves Muggles. Thinks
they're fascinating.",HARRY

19,RON,"Harry, sir. Harry Potter.",MR. WEASLEY
19,MR. WEASLEY,"Good Lord, are you really? Ron's

19,MR. WEASLEY,Did you now! How'd it go?!,MRS. WEASLEY
19,MR. WEASLEY,"I... I mean... That was very
wrong, boys. Very wrong indeed.
So, Harry. You must know all
about Muggles. Tell me, what
exactly is the function of a
parking meter?",RON

ashamed that a girl of no
wizarding family beat you in every
exam.",Draco Malfoy

70,Ron,Come on. Move. Now.,Harry
71,Ron,You're a Parselmouth! Why didn't you tell us?,Harry
71,Harry,I'm a what?,Ron
71,Hermione,You can talk to snakes.,Harry
71,Harry,"I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. But so what? I bet loads of people here can do it.",Hermione
71,Hermione,"No. They can’t. It's not a very common gift. This is bad, Harry.",Harry
71,Harry,What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin,Hermione
71,Ron,Oh that's what you said to it,Harry
71,Harry,You were there! You heard me!,Ron
71,Ron,I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake Language,Harry
71,Harry,I spoke a different language? But I didn't realize -- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?,Ron
71,Hermione,"I don't know, Harry. But it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something. It was... creepy.",Harry
71,Hermione,"Harry, listen out me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes too.",Harry
71,Ron,Exactly. And now the wholeschool's going to think you're his great-great-great grandson or something.,Harry
71,Harry,But I'm not. I can't be.,Ron
71,Hermione,He lived thousand of years ago. For all we know..you could be,Harry
73,Ernie,"So, anyway, I told Justin to hideup in our dormitory. I mean to say, if Potter's marked him down as his next victim, it's best he keep a low profile for a while.",Hannah
73,Hannah,But why would he want to attack Justin?,Ernie
73,Ernie,Justin let it slip to Potter that he was a muggleborn,Hannah
73,Hannah,You think Potter's the Heir of Slytherin?,Ernie
73,Ernie,"Hannah, he's a Parselmouth.Everyone knows that's the mark ofa dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.",Hannah
73,Ernie,"Remember what was written on thewall: Enemies of the Heir Beware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we know, Filch's cat's attacked. That first-year Creevey's been annoying Potter. Then Creevey's attacked.",Hannah
73,Hannah,"He always seems so nice, though.And, after all, he is the one who made You Know Who disappear.",Ernie
73,Ernie,That's probably why You Know Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn't want another Dark Lord competing with him.,Hannah
74,Hagrid,"All righ', Harry?",Harry
74,Harry,Hagrid... what're you doing here?,Hagrid

75,Argus Filch,"Caught in the act. I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words..",Harry
75,Argus Filch,"Dark magic. That's what you've got, Potter. Even the air you breathe comes out poison. You're evil. Evil as they come...",Harry
76,McGONAGALL,Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you,Harry
76,Harry,"Professor, your bird... I couldn't do anything... He just caught fire.",Dumbledore
76,Dumbledore,About time too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a Burning Day. He'sreally very handsome most of the time.,Harry

78,Harry,Maybe they're right,Ron
78,Hermione,Harry!,Harry
78,Harry,I didn't know I could speak Parseltongue. What else don't I know about myself? Maybe you can do something... even something horrible... and not know you did it.,Hermione
78,Hermione,"You don't believe that, Harry, I know you don't. And if it makes you feel better, I just heard Malfoy's staying over for holiday, too.",Harry
78,Ron,Why would that make anyone feel better?,Hermione
78,Hermione,"Because, in a few days, the Polyjuice Potion's will be ready.In a few days... we may truly know who is the Heir of Slytherin.",Ron
78,Hermione,Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.,Harry
78,Harry,Crabbe and Goyle,Hermione
78,Hermione,And we can't have the real Crabbe and Goyle burst in on us while we are interrogating Malfoy,Harry
78,Ron,How?,Hermione
78,Hermione,I got it all worked out. I've filled these with a simple sleeping Draught. Simple but powerful.,Ron
78,Hermione,You know how greedy Crabbe and Goyle are. They won't leave the Christmas Feast until every last drop of trifle is gone.,Ron
79,Hermione,"Now, once they're asleep, hide them in a broom cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs.",Ron

86,Draco Malfoy,"You know I haven't, Goyle. How many times do I have to tell you? But my father did say this much: It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it -- only that they were expelled -- but I knowthis: the last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died.",Harry

wrote about what he saw? It's possible he knew where the Chamber was, how to open it, even what sort of creature lives in it. If so, whoever's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want a diary like this lying around, would they?",HARRY
95,HARRY,"That's a brilliant theory, Hermione. With just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in this diary.",HERMIONE

108,HARRY,I think it's time to get my Dad's old Cloak out again.,RON
113,HAGRID,Who's there?,HARRY
114,HARRY,What's that for?,HAGRID
114,HAGRID,"Nothin', nothin'. I've been expectin'... Doesn't matter. Sit down... I'll make tea...",HARRY
114,HARRY,Are you okay? Hagrid? Did you hear about Hermione?,HAGRID
114,HAGRID,"Oh, yea. I heard, all righ'.",HARRY
114,HARRY,Look... we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?,HAGRID
114,HAGRID,C-come in.,DUMBLEDORE
114,DUMBLEDORE,"Good evening, Hagrid.",HAGRID
114,RON,"That's Dad's boss! Cornelius
Fudge. The Minister of Magic!",HARRY
114,FUDGE,"Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things've gone far enough. Ministry's got to act.",HAGRID
114,HAGRID,"I never... You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir...",FUDGE
114,HAGRID,"I never... You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir...",DUMBLEDORE

114,HAGRID,Take me? Where? Not Azkaban prison.,FUDGE
114,HAGRID,Take me? Where? Not Azkaban prison.,DUMBLEDORE

114,LUCIUS MALFOY,"Already here, Fudge? Good, good...",FUDGE
114,HAGRID,What're you doin' here! Get outta my house!,LUCIUS MALFOY
114,LUCIUS MALFOY,"My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your -- do you call this a house? I simply called at the school and was told the Headmaster was here",DUMBLEDORE
114,DUMBLEDORE,"And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?",LUCIUS MALFOY
114,LUCIUS MALFOY,"Dreadful thing, Dumbledore, but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension. You'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch. What with all these attacks, there'll be no Muggle- borns left at Hogwarts. And we all know what an awful loss that would be.",DUMBLEDORE
114,FUDGE,"Now, see here, Lucius. Dumbledore suspended. No, no... last thing
we want right now... If Dumbledore can't stop these attacks... I mean to say, who can?",LUCIUS MALFOY
114,LUCIUS MALFOY,"That remains to be seen, but as all twelve governors have voted --",FUDGE
114,HAGRID,"An' how many did yeh have ter
threaten before they agreed!",LUCIUS MALFOY
114,LUCIUS MALFOY,I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that.,HAGRID
114,HAGRID,Yeh can take Dumbledore! Take him away an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! There'll be killin's next!,DUMBLEDORE
114,DUMBLEDORE,"Calm yourself, Hagrid!",HAGRID
114,DUMBLEDORE,"If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside. However... you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who... ask for it.",HAGRID
114,LUCIUS MALFOY,"Admirable sentiments. We shall all miss your highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope your successor will manage to prevent any more, um, killin's.",DUMBLEDORE
114,HAGRID,"If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they'd have ter do is
follow the spiders. That'd lead
'em right! Tha's all I'm sayin'.",FUDGE

114,HARRY,Look...,RON
114,HARRY,C'mon.,RON
119,RON,What are you doing?,HARRY
119,HARRY,You heard Hagrid. Follow the spiders.,RON
119,RON,They're heading into the Dark Forest.,HARRY
119,RON,Why spiders. Why couldn't it be 'Follow the butterflies'?,HARRY
121,HARRY,"There's something moving over
there... something big.",RON
121,RON,"Harry!... Harry, it's our car!",HARRY
121,HARRY,It's been here all the time! Look at it. The Forest has turned it wild.,RON
121,HARRY,"C'mon, we don't want to lose the trail.",RON
121,RON,"I don't have a good feeling about this, Harry --",HARRY
121,HARRY,Don't panic.,RON
121,ARAGOG,You do not come from the forest. Your hearts beat like... men.,HARRY
121,HARRY,"Yes. We're friends of Hagrid's.
And you... you're...",ARAGOG
121,HARRY,"... Aragog, aren't you?",ARAGOG
121,ARAGOG,Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.,HARRY
121,HARRY,"He's in trouble. Up at school, there've been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he's opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.",ARAGOG
121,ARAGOG,That's a lie! Hagrid never opend the Chamber of Secrets!,HARRY
121,HARRY,But if Hagrid never... that means... you're not the monster.,ARAGOG
121,ARAGOG,"The monster was born in the castle. I came from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler.",HARRY
121,RON,Harry...,HARRY
121,HARRY,Shhh!,RON
121,HARRY,"But if you're not the monster, what did kill that girl fifty years ago?",ARAGOG
121,ARAGOG,We do not speak of it! It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.,HARRY
121,HARRY,But have you seen it?,ARAGOG
121,ARAGOG,"I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was
accused, Hagrid brought me here.",HARRY
121,HARRY,What!,ARAGOG
121,HARRY,Well... thank you. We'll just go...,ARAGOG
121,ARAGOG,"Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I cannot deny
them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst.
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.",HARRY
121,RON,Can we panic now?,HARRY
121,RON,Nice knowing you.,ARAGOG
121,HARRY,Let's go!,RON
121,HARRY,THE WINDOWS!   ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!,RON
121,RON,I CAN'T! IT'S STUCK!,HARRY
121,RON,Thanks for that.,RON
121,HARRY,Don't mention it.,RON
121,HARRY,That way! It's the only way out!,RON
121,HARRY,Can you get us in the air?,RON
121,RON,Flying gear's jammed!,HARRY
121,RON,"Follow the spiders'! Follow the spiders'! If he ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill Hagrid. I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?",HARRY
121,HARRY,We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.,RON
123,MADAM POMFREY,There's no point in talking to a petrified person. She won't hear a word you're saying.,RON
123,RON,"We know that, Madam Pomfrey. It's just, well, you see, we thought, maybe, we could... be with her for a bit. She's our... friend, you see, and... even if she can't hear us... I mean, it can't hurt, can it?",MADAM POMFREY
123,MADAM POMFREY,"Very well then. But be quick
about it.",RON
123,RON,"  You don't think Lockhart could be
             the heir of Slytherin, do you?",HARRY
123,RON,Right. Forget I said it.,HARRY
123,HARRY,"Wish you were here, Hermione. We
need you. Now more than ever...",HERMIONE
124,HARRY,"Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the Basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it and only the crowing of the rooster can kill it.'",RON
124,HARRY," Ron! This is it! The monster in
the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.
",RON
124,RON,"But it kills by looking people in
the eye. Why is it no one's dead?",HARRY
124,HARRY,Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly at least...,RON
124,HARRY,"Colin saw it through his camera.
Justin -- Justin must've seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost -- he couldn't die again...",RON
124,HARRY,"... And Hermione... had the mirror! I bet you anything she was using it to look round corners, in case it came along.",RON
124,RON,"And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.",HARRY
124,HARRY,The water... there was water on the floor that night. She only saw the Basilisk's reflection...,RON
124,HARRY,The crowing of the rooster is Fatal to it! That's why Hagrid's roosters were killed! Spiders Flee before it! It all fits!,RON
124,RON,But how's the Basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake. Someone would have seen...,HARRY
124,HARRY,Hermione answered that too.,RON
124,RON,"Pipes...? It's using the
plumbing.",HARRY
124,HARRY,Remember what Aragog said? About that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom. What if she never left.,RON
124,RON,Moaning Myrtle!,HARRY
124,McGONAGALL,All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the second floor corridor. Immediately.,EVERYONE

Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster. Into the Chamber itself.",EVERYONE
125,McGONAGALL,I'm afraid we shall have to send the students home. I'm afraid... this is the end of Hogwarts.,EVERYONE
125,GILDEROY LOCKHART,"So sorry. Dozed off. What have I
missed?",SNAPE
125,SNAPE,"Just the man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.",GILDEROY LOCKHART
125,GILDEROY LOCKHART,My m-moment?,SNAPE
125,SNAPE,Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?,GILDEROY LOCKHART
125,GILDEROY LOCKHART,D-did I? I don't recall..,SNAPE
125,McGONAGALL,"That settles it. We'll leave it to you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are legend",GILDEROY LOCKHART

inform the students what has
happened.",EVERYONE

126,RON,"She knew something, Harry. She'd found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That's why she was taken. I mean, she was -- is -- a pure-blood. There can't be any other reason.",HARRY
126,HARRY,"C'mon. Let's go see Lockhart. He may be a brainless git, but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him what we know...",RON
126,RON,"Harry. D'you think there's any chance at all she's not, you know --",HARRY
126,HARRY,"We'll find her, Ron. Ginny's going to be fine.

information for you --",GILDEROY LOCKHART

128,RON,What about my sister?,GILDEROY LOCKHART
128,GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Well, as to that -- most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I --",RON

Dark Arts teacher! You can't go
now!",GILDEROY LOCKHART

that stuff you did in your books?
",GILDEROY LOCKHART
128,GILDEROY LOCKHART,Books can be misleading.,HARRY
128,HARRY,You wrote them!,GILDEROY LOCKHART
128,GILDEROY LOCKHART,"My dear boy, do use your common sense. My books wouldn't have
sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things. No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves. He'd look dreadful on the front cover. No dress sense
at all...",HARRY
128,HARRY,You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what a load of other wizards have done!,GILDEROY LOCKHART
128,GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Harry, Harry, Harry. There was work involved. I had to track these people down and ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did. No, it's not all book signings and publicity photos. You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long, hard slog.",HARRY
128,RON,Is there anything you can do?,GILDEROY LOCKHART
128,GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Yes, now that you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would've gone blabbing and I'd never have sold another book. I'm afraid I'll have to do the same to you both, lest you do the same.",RON

130,HARRY,To ask you how you died.,MOANING MYRTLE
130,MOANING MYRTLE,"Oooooh, it was dreadful. It
happened right here. In this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in.",HARRY

130,MOANING MYRTLE,"I don't know! I was distraught! But they said something funny. A kind of made-up language. And I realized it was a boy speaking. So I unlocked the door, to tell him to go away, and... I died.",HARRY
130,HARRY,Just like that? How?,MOANING MYRTLE
130,MOANING MYRTLE,No idea. I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes. Over there...,HARRY

133,HARRY,But she's dying!,TOM RIDDLE
133,TOM RIDDLE,"Yes. I'm afraid so. But then, she's been in so much pain, poor Ginny. She's been writing to me for months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes. Ginny poured her soul out to me. I grew stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful enough to start feeding Ginny a few secrets, to start pouring a bit of my soul back into her...",HARRY
133,TOM RIDDLE,"Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.",HARRY
133,HARRY,No... she couldn't -- she wouldn't.,TOM RIDDLE
133,TOM RIDDLE,It was Ginny who set the Basilisk on the Mudbloods and the Squib's cat. Ginny who wrote threatening messages on the walls.,HARRY
133,HARRY,But... Why?...,TOM RIDDLE
133,TOM RIDDLE,"Because I told her to. You'll
find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew
what she was doing. She was,
shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her and she tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom. But then, who should find it... but you. The very person I was most anxious to meet.",HARRY
133,HARRY,And why did you want to meet me?,TOM RIDDLE
133,TOM RIDDLE,"Ginny told me all about you. I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust.",HARRY
133,HARRY,"Hagrid's my friend. And you framed him, didn't you?",TOM RIDDLE
133,TOM RIDDLE,It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think Hagrid was innocent.,HARRY
133,HARRY,I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.,TOM RIDDLE
133,TOM RIDDLE,"I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school. So I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day... I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.",HARRY

Mudbloods doesn't matter to me
anymore? For many months now, my
new target has been... you.",HARRY
133,TOM RIDDLE,Imagine my disappointment when I learned Ginny had stolen the diary back from you.,HARRY
133,HARRY,Ginny stole the diary from my room? But why?,TOM RIDDLE
133,TOM RIDDLE,She was afraid. Afraid you'd learn how to work the diary. Afraid I'd tell you just who it was that had been strangling all those roosters.,HARRY
133,HARRY,"Come now, Harry. Don't look so disappointed. Had Ginny succeeded in destroying the diary, she would have destroyed me. And we
couldn't be having this little talk. And I have so many
questions for you.",TOM RIDDLE
133,TOM RIDDLE,Like what?,HARRY
133,HARRY,"Well, how is it that a baby with
no extraordinary magical talent
managed to defeat the greatest
wizard of all time? How did you
escape with nothing but a scar,

eyes.",HARRY

still hear you!",HARRY

133,TOM RIDDLE,"Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly the venom of the Basilisk penetrates the body? If you have any final words, Potter, you'd best speak them now. I'd guess
you have little more than a minute to live.",HARRY
133,TOM RIDDLE,"So ends the famous Harry Potter. On his knees in the Chamber of Secrets. Defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You'll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry...",HARRY

135,DUMBLEDORE,"Of course, Tom Riddle was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen. I taught him myself fifty years ago. After he left, I would occasionally hear stories of his activities -- dark rumors -- but after awhile, even the rumors stopped. When he finally resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, most people had completely forgotten the clever Head Boy he'd once been.",HARRY

135,GINNY,But I understand if... given all the trouble I've caused... if you --,DUMBLEDORE
135,DUMBLEDORE,"Wiser wizards than you have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss Weasley. No, I think you've endured enough. I would suggest a bit of bed rest, however. And perhaps a large mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up. Minerva, will you show Arthur and Molly up to the hospital wing?",GINNY
135,McGONAGALL,"Certainly, Albus.",DUMBLEDORE
135,MRS. WEASLEY,"A diary that writes back to you! Honestly, Ginny! What were you thinking? Haven't I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain!",GINNY

135,HARRY,"It's just, you see, sir, I couldn't help noticing certain things. Certain similarities. Between Tom Riddle and me.",DUMBLEDORE
135,DUMBLEDORE,"You can speak Parseltongue, Harry, because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. Unless I'm much mistaken, he transformed some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar.",HARRY
135,HARRY,Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?,DUMBLEDORE
135,DUMBLEDORE,"Not intentionally, but... yes.",HARRY
135,HARRY,So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be a Slytherin.,DUMBLEDORE
135,DUMBLEDORE,"It's true, Harry. You do possess many of the qualities Voldemort himself prizes. Resourcefulness. Determination. A certain disregard for the rules. Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor.",HARRY
135,HARRY,Only because I asked it to.,DUMBLEDORE
135,DUMBLEDORE,"Exactly. Which makes you very different from Voldemort. It's not our abilities that show what we truly are, Harry. It's our choices.",HARRY

that Arthur Weasley's daughter had been taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.",LUCIUS MALFOY
135,DUMBLEDORE,"Curiously, several of them seemed under the impression that you would curse their families if they didn't agree to suspend me in the first place, Lucius.",LUCIUS MALFOY
135,LUCIUS MALFOY,"From the beginning, my only concern has been the welfare of this school and its students.
I assume the culprit has been identified.",DUMBLEDORE
135,DUMBLEDORE,"Oh yes. It was Voldemort. Only this time, he chose to act through someone else. By means of...
this.",LUCIUS MALFOY
135,DUMBLEDORE,"Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it.",LUCIUS MALFOY
135,DUMBLEDORE,"One only hopes that no more of
Lord Voldemort's old school things find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible could be...
severe.",LUCIUS MALFOY

yours.",LUCIUS MALFOY
