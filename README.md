# Data-Exploration-Project

I performed text and sentimental analysis on the script of the second Harry Potter movie's script in order to find some connections between the characters. I created a neural network to demonstrate these connections.

There are 7 scripts file in total. The variables and library of some files relied on the others, so please run our code in the number order named from 1 to 7.
